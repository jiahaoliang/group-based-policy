NFP Zero Friction for Enterprise Mode Deployment
==================================================
1. Added the bellow file in diskimage-create dir
    1.local.conf
    2.test.sh
    3.upgrade.py

2. upgrade_mode.ini file is to be create. Right now we are using nessecrry parameters directly

3. Run following commands.
   
   1. Before starting this script setup should be installed with advanced mode(i.e on top of advanced mode setup will run this file)
 
   2. python upgrade.py

This will do :
      1. Get all the enterprise drivers of configurator and prepare configurator docker.
      2. Get visibility source code and prepare visibility docker.
      3. Prepare the enterprise VM image containing configurator and visibility dockers.

Pending Task :

      1. Launch the new VM with configurator and visibility dockers in single VM. Pass required user data while booting the VM.
      2. Assign floating IP address to the new VM.
      3. Get the fixed IP address of service mgmt port from the new VM and configure it in the proxyâ€™s ini file. Send a SIGHUP to proxy process for configuration reload. Proxy will be enhanced to support the configuration reload.
      4. Bring down the configurator VM
